Compile Instructions:
*********************
Fill in the makefile with the compile compand for the corresponding problem.
ex.

	Problem1:	Problem1.cpp Problem1.h
		g++ -std=c++17 -ggdb Problem1.cpp -o Problem1	

Make sure that you use a [TAB] when indenting.

Now you can compile in bash (the terminal) using

	make Problem1

If you are using vim, you can compile from inside vim using

	: make Problem1

Assignment Comments
*********************
Make sure to use appropriate variable names, and plenty of descriptive comments. 

Push your work to your github fork after each problem is completed or when you need need help. See below for github instructions..

Once you have finished all problems, create a pull-request on the main project page. See below for github instructions. 


**********
Problem 1
**********
Write a Progem that produces the sum of all the numbers in a file of whitespace-seperated integers. A simple input file has been provided as problem1.input 

**********
Problem 2
**********
Write a program that creates a file of data in the form of the temperature Reading type defined in §10.5. For testing, fill the file with at least 50 "temperature readings." Call this program store_temps.cpp and the file it creates raw_temps.txt. Try to see if you can make the the output random integers; otherwise any output will be fine.

**********
Problem 3
**********
Write a program that reads the data from raw_temps.txt created in Problem 2 into a vector and then calculates and outputs the average and median temperatures in your data set. Call this program temp_stats.cpp. 

**********
Problem 4
**********
Modify the store_temps.cpp program from Problem2 to include a temperature suffix c for Celsius or f for Fahenheit temperatures. Then modify the temp_stats.cpp program to test each temperature, converting the Celcius readings to Farenheit before putting them into the vector.

**********
Problem 5
**********
Write a program that accepts two file names and produces a new file that is the contents of the first filefollowed by the contents of the second; that is, the program concatinates the two files. Two sample input files have been provided.

**********
Problem 6
**********
Write a program that takes two files containing sorted whitespace-seperated words and merges them, preserving order. Use the sample input files that were used in Problem 5.
