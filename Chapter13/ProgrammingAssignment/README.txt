## Problem1 
Define a class Regular_hexagon (polygon with six-sides all of the same length. 
Use the center and the distance from the center to a corner point as constructor arguments.

## Problem 2
Tile part of a window tih Regular_hexagons , use at least 8 (line them up so no gaps, and no overlaps)
Hint: You will probably need to use a little bit of trigonometry to figure out where the centers should be.

## Problem 3
Draw a cirlcle and place a "mark" on it. Move the mark around the circle every time you press the next button.

## Problem 4
Define a class Regular_tringle that represents an equilateral triangel. Use 8 regular triangles to display an octogon.

## Problem 5
Use Regular_triangle to tile the window so there are no gaps or overlaps.
