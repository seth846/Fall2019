## make sure you are working on the chapter13 branch

1) Make an 800 x 1000 Simple_window.

2) Put an 8 x 8 grid on the leftmost part of the window (each square is 100 x 100)

3) make the eight squares on the diagonal starting from the top left corner red (hint: use Rectangle)

4) Find a 200 x 200 image (JPEG or GIF) and place thee copies of it on the grid (each image covering 4 squares. 
	Don't obscure the red squares (red shows up on top).

5) Add a 100 x 100 image. Have it move around from square to square when you click the next button. 
	(Just put wait_for_botton() in a loop with some code that picks a new square for your image)
