 a precompiled package of code that is meant to be used by other programs and is generally split into two parts: a header file and the binary implementation
2) What is a static library? (same link as above)
a library of code that is compiled and linked with your program and is accessed through the executable
3) What is the file extension of a library (static and shared, see link)?
the header file or implementation file
4) Look in FLTK/Makefile; Where did it put this library?
in user/local
5) Look in FLTK/Makefile; Where did it put the header files?
in MyFLTK
6) Look at the Makefile in FLTK/example. How do we compile with a library?
lbMyFLTK.a

html deals with text while FLTK can use shapes and text

no, its just a method of adding context and structure to text

a member function with the same name as its class
16) How do we access members of a class?
through user defined member functions
17) What is a namespace?
