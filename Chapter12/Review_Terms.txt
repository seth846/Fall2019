1) What is a code library? (https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/)
 a precompiled package of code that is meant to be used by other programs and is generally split into two parts: a header file and the binary implementation
2) What is a static library? (same link as above)
a library of code that is compiled and linked with your program and is accessed through the executable
3) What is the file extension of a library (static and shared, see link)?
the header file or implementation file
4) Look in FLTK/Makefile; Where did it put this library?
in user/local
5) Look in FLTK/Makefile; Where did it put the header files?
in MyFLTK
6) Look at the Makefile in FLTK/example. How do we compile with a library?
g++ example.cpp -o example -lMyFLTK -lfltk -lfltk_images
7) What is the difference between a graphics library (like FLTK) and HTML?
HTML simply formats text and images while FLTK actually draws objects on the screen
8) What does HTML stand for?
hypertext markup language

no, its just a method of adding context and structure to text
10) What is TeX? (may need to google)
a formatting system used for text documents
11) What is a GUI?
a space where the user can interact with the code(graphical user interface)
12) What is an enum class? 
give a group of symbolic constants values with default starting at 0 and increasing by one for each value

a class has a public and private section and supports subclasses but a struct does not
14) What are the two parts of a class?
public and private
15) What is a constructor?
a member function with the same name as its class
16) How do we access members of a class?
through user defined member functions
17) What is a namespace? 
 group of declarations to classes, libraries, and header files
